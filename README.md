Here we store PAC-scripts generated by servers.  

This repo always contains only one commit that is overriden (like `git push --force`).  
README file survives commit overrides.

# PAC-scripts

Each PAC-script is given a name to distinguish it from our other PAC-scripts.  
Currently we support the following scripts:

Name          | Filename           | Homepage | Author
--------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------
Anticensority | anticensority.pac  | [Here](https://rebrand.ly/ac-anticensority) | ilyaigpetrov
Antizapret    | proxy.pac          | [There](https://antizapret.prostovpn.org)   | ValdikSS
